    <h1>☕ Unknown Coffee Facts</h1>

    <div class="fact">
      <h3><span class="fact-number">1.</span>Coffee Was Once Eaten, Not Drunk</h3>
      <p>In ancient Africa, tribes ground coffee berries and mixed them with animal fat to create portable energy balls. These were used during long hunts and journeys, making coffee one of the earliest "energy snacks."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fact">
      <h3><span class="fact-number">2.</span>The Word "Coffee" Comes from Arabic</h3>
      <p>The word “coffee” evolved from the Arabic “qahwa,” which referred to wine. As it spread to Turkey (kahve) and Italy (caffè), the modern term “coffee” was born.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fact">
      <h3><span class="fact-number">3.</span>Beethoven Used Exactly 60 Beans</h3>
      <p>Ludwig van Beethoven was so meticulous about his coffee that he counted exactly 60 beans per cup before brewing — showcasing his love for precision in all things.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fact">
      <h3><span class="fact-number">4.</span>Coffee Was Banned in Several Countries</h3>
      <p>Throughout history, coffee was banned in places like Mecca, Italy, and Sweden. Authorities feared that its stimulating effects encouraged rebellion and free thinking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fact">
      <h3><span class="fact-number">5.</span>Second Most Traded Commodity</h3>
      <p>Globally, coffee is the second most traded commodity after crude oil. Over 2.25 billion cups are consumed every single day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fact">
      <h3><span class="fact-number">6.</span>Espresso Has Less Caffeine Than Drip Coffee</h3>
      <p>While espresso is more concentrated, a full cup of drip-brewed coffee usually contains more caffeine in total — due to its larger volume.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fact">
      <h3><span class="fact-number">7.</span>Coffee Can Bloom Like a Flower</h3>
      <p>When freshly ground coffee is brewed with hot water, it releases trapped carbon dioxide, creating a blooming effect. This is a sign of freshness, especially in pour-over methods.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fact">
      <h3><span class="fact-number">8.</span>Coffee Beans Are Actually Seeds</h3>
      <p>The "beans" we brew are actually the seeds inside the coffee cherry. They’re only called beans because of their resemblance to legumes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fact">
      <h3><span class="fact-number">9.</span>Finland Drinks the Most Coffee per Person</h3>
      <p>Finns consume more coffee per capita than any other country — over 12 kilograms per person every year. That’s nearly 4 cups a day per person!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fact">
      <h3><span class="fact-number">10.</span>Caffeine Blocks Sleep Chemicals</h3>
      <p>Caffeine doesn't give you energy directly — it works by blocking adenosine, the chemical that tells your brain it’s time to sleep. That’s why you feel alert after a cup.</p>
